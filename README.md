# Machine_Learning_Final
This is my machine learning final project. In short I use the Viterbi algorithm to see if the score of a golfer can be predicted by the mood of the golfer throughout the round.
Also, if you are an employer there are a few repositories which are not open to the public at request of my professors, 
I can grant access if requested.
